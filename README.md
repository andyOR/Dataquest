## 1. Python Programming

### This is first course in Data Science Path. In this course, I have learnt the basics of python including files and loop, List operations, dictionaries and creating functions.

### Datasets used in this course includes:
#### a. "crime_rates.csv" contains crime rate data for 73 cities in the United States

This was used to analyze a superstitious notion around Birthday among Parents https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv


## 2. Data Analysis and Visualization 
###     This is the second course in the data scientist path. In this course, I have learnt NumPy, Pandas libraries, Data manipulation, working with missing data, creating Line Charts, Multiple plots, histograms, bar and scatter plots, conditional plots etc.It also includes data cleaning techniques, merging different datasets.

### Datasets used in this course includes:
#### a. "world_alcohol.csv" file which contains data consumption    of alcohol per capita in different countries
#### b. "food_info.csv" file containing nutritional information   on the most common foods Americans consume
https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/usda-national-nutrient-database-for-standard-reference/
#### c. "titanic_survival.csv" file containing titanic dataset    and information on the passengers travelling through titanic
#### d. "all-ages.csv" file for all ages group employment data and "recent-grads.csv" file on recent grads from majors employment data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the data set and made it available in a Github repository
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors. 
#### e. "fandango_score_comparison.csv" file containing user ratings on movies by users and critics on different platforms of rottentomatoes, fandango, etc
This file can be downloaded from this repository "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango"
#### e1. "thanksgiving.csv" containing survey of thanksgiving data among consumers. It contains 1058 responses. Most of the column names are questions, and most of the column values are string responses to the questions. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015
#### f. "unrate.csv" file on monthly unemployment rate in US from 1948 till August 2016
#### f1. "recent-grads.csv" containing use dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it here https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv
#### g. "percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv" file on on percentage of bachelor's degrees gratnted to women from 1970 to 2012
#### h. "train.csv" file of the titanic shipwreck used on Kaggle learning platform to build machine learning model to predict the surviving chances of passenger. It can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
#### i. "airlines.csv", "airports.csv", and "routes.csv" files describing Geographic dataset to visualize the data on maps. This dataset can be accessed from https://openflights.org/data.html

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education
#### h. Civil Rights Data Collection containing information on educational achievement and opportunities in the U.S., broken down by race and school https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/civil-rights-data-collection-2013-14

## 3. The Command Line
###  This is the third course in data science path. In this course, I have learnt about the command line interface. A command line interface lets us switch between folders and launch programs by typing commands. A command line interface is often faster and more powerful than a GUI for programming tasks.

### This course includes:
#### a. Command Line Basics
#### b. Working with files through command line
#### c. Command Line python scripting
#### d. Working with programs through command line
#### e. Working with downloads in command line
#### f. Working with Jupyter console from command line
#### g. Challenge- Data Munging Using The Command Line
#### h. Piping and redirecting output
#### i. Transforming data with Python
#### f. Data Cleaning and Exploration using Csvkit
#### g. Git and Version Control

### Datasets used in this course includes:
#### a. "hn_stories.csv" conatining dataset of submissions to Hacker News from 2006 to 2015. Hacker News is a site where users can submit articles from across the internet and others can "upvote" the articles, signifying that they like them.
dataset compiled by Arnaud Drizard can be found here

## 4. Working with Data Sources
### This is fourth course in data science path. In this course, I have learnt about working with data in different locations, including databases and on the web.

### This course includes:
#### a. Working with APIs
#### b. Intermediate APIs
#### c. Working with Reddit API
#### d. Web Scraping
#### e. Introduction to SQL
