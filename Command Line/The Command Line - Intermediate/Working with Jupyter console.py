## In this script, we will learn to working with Jupyter console from command Line
## The Jupyter console, formerly known as IPython, is an enhanced Python interpreter
## The main difference between Jupyter console and Jupyter notebook is that the console functions in interactive mode.
## Whenever you type a line of code, it is immediately executed, and you can see the results.
## If you want to write medium-length pieces of code or do deep exploration of a dataset, the notebook is better.
## If you want to test out code you're writing, or run quick commands, the console is better


## Open the Jupyter console

ipython ## typing this command at command line


## Getting Help

help(dq)

## Persistent Sessions
# Just like with Jupyter notebook, Jupyter console starts a kernel session when you first load it.
# Every time you run code in the console, the variables are stored in the session. Any subsequent lines you execute can access those variables
