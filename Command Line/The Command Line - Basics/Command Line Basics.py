## In this script, we will learn basics of command line interface
## A command line interface lets us switch between folders and launch programs by typing commands.
## A command line interface is often faster and more powerful than a GUI for programming tasks


## Basic commands

pwd ## to print working diirectory
cd /## to move to home or root directory


## Absolute Vs. Relative Paths


## Getting Back To The Dq Folder

cd dq # if we are home folder containing dq


## Understanding Users

whoami # current user


## The Home Directory

cd ~


## Making A New Directory

mkdir ## make directory in current folder
mkdir /home/dq/test # directory with absolute path


## Using Command Options To Modify Behavior

mkdir -v test2 # command option to show output expressions
# output - mkdir: created directory 'test2'


## Reviewing Available Command Options

mkdir --help


## Listing The Contents Of A Directory

ls -1


## Removing A Directory

rmdir test2
